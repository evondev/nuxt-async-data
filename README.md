This repository contains the example code for the [Async Data with Nuxt.js](https://vueschool.io/courses/async-data-with-nuxtjs) course.


It can be difficult and cumbersome to set up a custom system to fetch asynchronous data before you serve your application to your users and render everything on the server-side. Since JavaScript was designed to mainly run client-side, it comes with a few unwanted traits.

Nuxt.js has made it breathtakingly easy to fetch asynchronous data and render our entire application on the server-side before we serve it to our users. In this course, you will learn a few different methods to fetch asynchronous data and what to be careful with. Secondly, you'll learn how to fetch asynchronous data and render your Nuxt applications server-side.

**Server-side rendering brings invaluable performance and SEO benefits.**

Even though it is impressively smooth to fetch and render async data server-side with Nuxt.js, you need to know the basics of Nuxt. If you do not, we recommend our [Nuxt.js Fundamanetals](https://vueschool.io/courses/nuxtjs-fundamentals) course.

After this course, you will be familiar with:
- How to best fetch asynchronous data according to your applications needs
- The caveats of the `fetch` method when it comes to server-side rendering
- The benefits of using Nuxt modules
- How to extend the Nuxt.js framework with plugins
- Fetching async data and render your Vuex store server-side
- Impressed with how easy it is to squeeze out extra performance and SEO of your JavaScript applications with Nuxt.js

This course is made **together** with Nuxt.js core member **Alexander Lichter**.
